I cannot generate code for a JPG image file. Image files are binary assets that cannot be created through code generation - they must be created using image editing software or obtained from photography/design sources.

For the placeholder image `images/company-team.jpg` specified in your requirements, you have several options:

1. **Use a placeholder service** (temporary):
   - https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800/0066cc/ffffff?text=ThermoCool+Team
   - https://placehold.co/1200x800/0066cc/ffffff/png?text=ThermoCool+Team

2. **Use free stock photos** from:
   - Unsplash (https://unsplash.com)
   - Pexels (https://pexels.com)
   - Pixabay (https://pixabay.com)
   
   Search terms: "HVAC team", "technicians", "professional team", "facility"

3. **Create a professional image** with:
   - Canva (free templates available)
   - Adobe Express
   - GIMP (free, open-source)

4. **Commission custom photography** of actual ThermoCool team/facility

**Recommended specifications for the image:**
- Dimensions: 1200x800px (3:2 aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG
- Quality: 80-85% (balance between quality and file size)
- File size: < 200KB (optimized for web)
- Content: Professional team photo or facility image
- Color scheme: Align with brand colors (#0066cc primary blue)

Since this is a binary asset, it must be obtained or created outside of code generation and then placed in the `images/` directory.
